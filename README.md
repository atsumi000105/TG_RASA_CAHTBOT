# HR-Chatbot-with-Telegram-UI
Building Human Resource chatbot using RASA framework and integrating it with Telegram user interface. Design of the chatbot is simple and users don't need to  install any third party application as the chatbot is deployable in telegram. Intents and responses are customizable according to each domain requirements .

This chatbot is useful for new hires who want to learn the business but are waiting too long for answers from HR or seniors. 
Deploying it on Telegram by creating a proxy server using NGROK and authenticating it with telegram access token.
